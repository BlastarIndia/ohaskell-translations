A repo for translations of О Haskell по-человечески (http://ohaskell.ru/)

With any luck, we can provide accurate translations in multiple languages (with an initial focus on English), and assist Denis in improving his book by our own adaptations and additions.

If you are interested in contributing, please fork and make a pull request or open an issue requesting commit access along with some information about you (Russian fluency, familiarity with Haskell, favorite Leningrad song, etc.).

There are no current limitations on format, but `pandoc`-friendly Markdown seems most appropriate.

Happy hacking!
