### For what reason ###

Functional programming is like a ghetto amidst a worldwide megapolis of software development. Functional languages' market share is very small, and the programmers, who use these languages, are considered either an unreachable elite or antisocial idiots. The goal of this book is to destroy such a view.

In particular, I'll prove the fallacy of two views on Haskell, namely

- a colossal complexity of mastering Haskell
- a belief that Haskell is suitable only for MIT scientific labs

Yes, in the past both these views were true. Haskell oficially exists since 1990, but its "worldwide release" began only in 2003. So during 13 years this language was really just for laboratories, and it was hard to study, because all documentation, available at that moment, was full of maths. The language back then was slow. There were few libraries. But what was relevant at that time, is not relevant today.

A few words about expectations. Do not expect a thorough review of Haskell and its ecosystem. Moreover, it is not a reference book. I will not copy the whole contents of Haskell official website here or translate Haskell 2010 standard. Also I will not provide any information that you can easily find on Wikipedia (like the history of Haskell).

The goal of this book is to lend a helping hand to newbies in the very beginning of their way.
