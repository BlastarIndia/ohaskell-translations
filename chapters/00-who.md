And I'm an ordinary programmer. Autodidact. I once thought that software development is the most boring view of human activity. The last eight years I think it's one of the most interesting profession.

Fred Brooks was right, there's no silver bullet. But we're looking for a new tools to deal with our daily tasks. So, after 7 years of programming in C++, I decided to look for something new, for the greater efficiency of my work.

I was tired of the complexity of C++. Yes, it's a very good language, but I wanted something new... Something native compilable, and something high-level, and with strong typing, and with beautiful syntax, and multi-purpose, and... simpler. Yes, I wanted just that. Accidentally saw the Haskell - and I was immediately hooked.

First of all, the lack of an assignment operator. This fact shocked me, and I decided to investigate.

Secondly, beauty. I love beautiful code, and Haskell code can be really beautiful.

Third, the power. Keep reading, and you'll see it soon.

And finally, the simplicity. Yes, simplicity. I know that functional programming didn't associate with the word "simple". In particular, there's a rumor that studying of Haskell is very, very complex. But I repeat: this language amazed me with its simplicity. And you'll see what I mean.
