### Why ###

And really, why? Why have I decided to write another book about Haskell?

Reason number one: I'm sick of it! Almost all Haskell tutorials I know begin with a demonstration of how to implement the Quicksort algorithm. And something about the factorial and Fibonacci numbers. What?? Do you remember last time you worked with Fibonacci numbers? I've never worked with them.

Historically, most of us have started our professional career with imperative languages. And what do we see in most Haskell tutorials? Do we see the functional language in the light of its practical usage? Nope, we see Fibonacci numbers and mathematical notation... Of course, an ordinary programmer starts to feel as a very... hmm, stupid guy, and such a feeling suppresses his desire to study this "strange functionality".

That's why I talk humanly about Haskell, with minimal academism and with crystal clear examples.

There is also a second reason. In my opinion, all books about Haskell are too large. They have a lot of noise. But we don't have a lot of time to read another 500 pages large work. That's why I talk about Haskell as succinctly as possible.
