### Why ###

And really, why? Why am I decided to write another book about Haskell?

Reason one: I sick of it! Almost all Haskell tutorials I know begins with a demonstration of how to implement the Quicksort algorithm. And something about the factorial and Fibonacci numbers. What?? Do you remember when you worked with Fibonacci numbers last time? I never worked with it.

Historically, most of us have started our professional way with imperative languages. And what we see in most of Haskell's tutorials? Maybe, we see functional language in the light of its practical usage? Nope, we see Fibonacci numbers and mathematical notation... Of course, ordinary programmer starts to feel as a very... hmm, stupid guy, and such a feeling suppresses his desire to study this "strange functionality".

That's why I talk about Haskell by humanly, with a minimum of academism and with a really clear examples.

There is a second reason. In my opinion, all books about Haskell are too large. They have a lot of noise. But we don't have a lot of time to read another huge work in 500 pages. That's why I talk about Haskell as succinctly as possible.
