### About Hackage ###

If you have experience with Linux, you are familiar with the term "repository": a centralized place where you can get lots of different things. So Hackage is the main repository in the Haskell world.

The name is the fusion of two words - "Haskell" and "package". It exists since 2008 and has lots and lots of packages. Consider package as a library, but in Haskell world the term "package" is used.

Amongst this pile you can find lots of existing solutions, both for regular and specialized tasks.

In order to use the package you need to make four steps:

- find this package
- install it
- add to the project
- import the necessary modules

#### Looking for packages ####

I recommend searching here:

- Hoogle
- Hayoo!

Just enter the necessary name, category or some relevant word and you'll get a lot of interesting results.
