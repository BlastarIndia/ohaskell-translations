### For whom ###

If you have read up to this point - this book is for you. And do not worry about your level of expertise: if you already know, what a compiler is, why user-defined types are necessary, and what is the difference between function declaration and function definition - continue reading.

I have to confess: at the moment of writing this book I had no development experience with Haskell and hadn't even finished learning it. Many of you might be surprised: how can a man who has no experience and broad knowledge of functional programming, start writing a book about Haskell?!

The main obstacle on the way of popularizing this language (and functional programming in general) is that people talking about it are often too far from regular developers and regular tasks, which these developers solve. And most of us, while reading something written by a MIPT graduate student, often think: "I'm too stupid for this"...

That's why the author of this book is a regular programmer. I see Haskell not as an object of scientific study, but as a tool for solving everyday tasks. Most of other developers are like me. And if I could grasp the concept of functional paradigm - so can you.

Maybe you'll fall in love with this language. Maybe it'll disgust you. But I can promise: you won't be bored at all.

Let's begin.
